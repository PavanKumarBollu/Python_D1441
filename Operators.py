"""
to perform some calculations we need help that help we will get from the operators

Operator --> it is a simbol which has some predefined meaning and helps us to do some basic calculations
Operand  --> the actaul values which are involved in operations
Examples
a - b
10 + 20

here a ,  b are operands
10 ,20 are also operands
where are + , - are operators


"""

"""Types of operators are:
 Arithmetic Operators: -
    addition +
    subtraction -
    multiplication *
    division /
    modulo %
    exponentiation **
    floor division //
    
 comparison operators: -
    Equality operator: ==
    Not Equality operator: !=
    less than < 
    greater than > 
    less than or equal to <=
    greater than or equal to >= 
 
    
 logical Operators:
        and 
        or 
        not 
 assignment operators :
    equals =
    +=
    -=
    *=
    /=
    %=
    **=
 membership operators:
    in
    not in
    
 Identity 
    is
    is not (negated identity)
 
 bitwise operators
    & bitwise and
    | bitwise  or
    >> right shift
    << left shift
    ^ XOR
    ~ NOT
 
 Ternary Operator :
