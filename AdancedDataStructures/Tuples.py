"""
Tuples
------
a tuple is a in-built data structure
it is ordered and immutable
duplicates are allowed inside the tuple

features

ordered
immutable
multiple data types it can store
we will have the indexing
iterating over elements is possible

tuple is mainly used as dictionary keys
fixed in size (once it is created we can't modify the tuple)
