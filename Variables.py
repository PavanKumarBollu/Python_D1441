"""
in python when you want to save something for using later purpose then we need to use something called variables


variables --> variables are like empty boxes you can keep anything inside that box(varible)
to create an variable we need to do the following

variable_name = variable_value
variable_name = expression_which_will_produce_some_result

example:-
name = "PK"
result = a+b+c

here name , result are variable names and "PK" is a direct value and a+b+c is an expression which will produce some output
