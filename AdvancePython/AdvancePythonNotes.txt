what is advanced python
what is library ..?
what is framework ..?


when you download python into our system what exactly happens..?

when we download the python into our system it will be a bunch of files contains some
internal logics to make the python work like in-built functions logics, conditional statements logics
, functions logics ...etc (.class files of the logics will be donloaded and used for execution of the code)

along with the internal logic it will contain some files related to compiler working

matrics
arrays
pivot table
charts
.
.
.
.etc

since the python is widely used programming language keeping everying in a single place and make the people download everything
just for learning the core concept is not a good idea

so they have divided the concepts into groups based on the work and use of those concepts

here the groups is named as libraries


libraries are nothing but collection of similar file which will help us to fulfill some specific requirement

like when you want to work with excel files then we can choose pandas library

what is framework ..?
---------------------
to make the developers life easy in coding they will take the help of frameworks to auto-complete the code
or maintain some structure ...etc





Numpy
----

numpy is a one of the famous python library which will help us to work with numerical type data
like arrays, multidimensional arrays, matrics, it contains some functions to work on arrays

these numpy library is used in machine learning, researchAndEngineering ... etc


features of numpy
-----------------
element-wise-operations
multidimensional data
mathematical Functions
Generating Random Generating
effectively collaborates with other libraries


for downloading the libraries we have two ways
    1. using cmd(terminal)
    2. using GUI

 pip install numpy
