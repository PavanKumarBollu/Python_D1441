Apps develop 
System instruction 
collection of program to create application
to speak with computer we need programming language
to perform specific task we will provide some instruction then we will get the results
OOP --> 
its a medium between human and computer 
foundations of software development
cross platform integration 
robust applications

System ---> Computer --> Robot ( AI )  --> 

system level language( 0's and 1's)
---------------------
when we want to control the computer we have to tell the instruction(orders) in 0's and 1's
some people has written some programs in 0's and 1's also --> these kind of people on those days are like aliens from other planet 

0001 --> 1
0010 --> 2
0011 --> 3
.
.
.
.

so much difficult to write the programs in 0's and 1's 
they started working on this problem and found on solution that is called assembly level language


assembly level language
-----------------------
they have taken some commonly used functionalities and kept it with some name and that some names we will call it as keywords

add -> addition
subtract -> subtraction 
.
.
.
.
division --> divides the numbers

here the job is little bit easy for the programmers -- 
but it is very difficult to do the long calculations


then again they started working on this 
then they found something which will work as a intermediate between the programmer and computer 
that is high level programming languages --> C

high level programming languages 
--------------------------------

c, C++, java. js,  python, php, go, r, cobal, pascal, ruby, .......... 9000+ languages in the world may be more

which lang to learn..?

completely depends on what you wanna do.




C++ -- > when you speak about memory level then C++ Will be always there
-------------------------------------------------------------------------




high level language --> interpreter (compiler) --> 0'1 and 1's ---> output

Python (Tell what do you want the system to do) -->  interpreter(compiler)  -->  0'1 and 1's --> output


interpreter Or compiler are the intermediates bet ween the high level language and computer level language





Task
-----

history and features of python 


installing the python
---------------------

https://www.python.org/downloads/

after downloading the python
then we need the help of IDE(integrated Developing Environment )
we can use any fvt ide like vscode or PyCharm , anaconda, online compiler, idle ... etc 

pycharm link
